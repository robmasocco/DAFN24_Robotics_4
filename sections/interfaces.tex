% --- Defining custom interfaces ---
\begin{frame}{Defining custom interfaces}{From package organization to build}
  Custom communication interfaces can be defined in \textbg{appropriate packages}.\\
  \bigskip
  The organization of such packages is regulated by a set of \textbg{best practices}.\\
  \bigskip
  When these packages are built, they generate both \textbg{code to include in} and \textbg{libraries to link against} the packages using them.\\
  \bigskip
  For everything to work, each package must have \textbg{the same interface packages} as \textbg{dependencies}, as well as link against \textbg{the same generated code}.\\
